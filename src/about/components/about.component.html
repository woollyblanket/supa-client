                <strong>Why did we build the app?</strong>
                <p>Once upon a time, Wasfi was hungry. He wanted to get some yummy salad in his tummy, but knowing that salad doesn't grow on trees, Wasfi wanted to shop around. Not finding a single, unified place to compare the prices of his shopping list, he had an "Aha!" moment, and the site you see before you was born.</p>

                <p>Mohamed, or Wasfi as he likes to be called, is a cool cat. Friends call him "Fifi". You can call him Fifi too, but be prepared to be given a nickname of your own</p>

               <p>Marco is a high flying business man. He leads all of his meetings while on the move. If on the occassion that he has to sit down, he borrows a aeroplane figureen from Wasfi, just so he can feel like he's on the move. </p>
               <br>
               <p>Marco loves movies. If he could pack it all in and become a movie star, he would, just so long as the director doesn't mind if he acts while on the move</p>
