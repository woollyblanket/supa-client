<h1>Why did we build the app?</h1>
<p>Once upon a time, Wasfi was hungry. He wanted to get some yummy salad in his tummy, but knowing that salad doesn't grow on trees, Wasfi wanted to shop around. Not finding a single, unified place to compare the prices of his shopping list, he had an "Aha!" moment, and the site you see before you was born.</p>
